Changes since 7.0.0
    - Added setting to be able to use "Logitech Number Pad" which we cannot use in Mac OS X.
      Activate "Change KeyPad Key > Logitech Number Pad Hack".
    - Replaced StatusWindow with Growl.
      StatusWindow was displaying the lock state of modifiers and extra message.
      Now, these messages are shown by Growl.
